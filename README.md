# flutter_google_maps_sample

This project is about how to use Google Maps and Geolocator plugins in a Flutter app. In this project,  user location information is being taken instantly and demonstrated on Google maps. At the first opening, it opens with the user location exactly.  When there is a  change of user location, the view of maps is being animated according to location information. Additionally, it can be setting a marker position such as a place that users want to arrive.
